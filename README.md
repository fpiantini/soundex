A C++ Soundex implementation written to learn TDD

Soundex is a phonetic algorithm for indexing names by sound, as pronounced in English. The goal is for homophones to be encoded to the same representation so that they can be matched despite minor differences in spelling. See for example the [Wikipedia page] for other details.

The code in this project has been written to learn TDD in C++ using gtest and gmock.
